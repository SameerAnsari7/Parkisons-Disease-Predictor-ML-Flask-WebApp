git clone https://github.com/SameerAnsari7/Parkinsons-Disease-Predictor-ML-Flask-WebApp.git
cd Parkinsons-Disease-Predictor-ML-Flask-WebApp

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3.Install the dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. Start the Flask development server:
  python app.py
2. Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:5000 to access the web application.
3. Use the interface to input the required information, and the ML model will make predictions accordingly.

## Data

Data Source:
Explain where the dataset came from and how it was collected. The source of the data could be a public repository, a research institute, a hospital, or any other data provider. If it is a public dataset, consider providing a link to the original source.

Data Format:
Describe the structure and format of the dataset. Specify the features (input variables) and the target label (output variable) in the dataset. Include details about data types, whether the features are numerical or categorical, and if any data preprocessing was required to convert the data into a usable format.
